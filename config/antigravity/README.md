# Windsurf (Antigravity) Configuration

**Status:** Planned

Windsurf/Antigravity-specific configuration is planned for a future release.

## Interim Solution

Windsurf is based on VS Code, so the VS Code configuration should work as a baseline:

1. Copy configuration files from `config/vscode/`
2. Apply them using Windsurf's settings interface
3. Note that some features may behave differently

## Contributing

If you'd like to help create Windsurf-specific configurations, contributions are welcome!
