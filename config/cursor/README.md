# Cursor Configuration

**Status:** Planned

Cursor-specific configuration is planned for a future release.

## Interim Solution

Cursor is based on VS Code, so the VS Code configuration should work as a baseline:

1. Copy configuration files from `config/vscode/`
2. Apply them using Cursor's settings interface
3. Note that some features may behave differently

## Contributing

If you'd like to help create Cursor-specific configurations, contributions are welcome!
